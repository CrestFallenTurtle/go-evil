# Go evil

Customizing evil has never been so easy


Take a look at the provided examples in the example folder and the information found in the wikis.

### Example code
Basic example
```
main:{
    window.x("600"); @ Set the size on the x axis
    window.y("800"); @ Set the size on the y axis
    window.title("You just got hacked bruh!");
    window.goto("https://mrskeltal.com/"); @ Goes to the webiste specified

    system.exit("0"); @ Preventions the never ending loop
}
```
