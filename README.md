# Go evil

Customizing evil has never been so easy

# Note: there is a lot of stuff not done with this project and therefore there really isn't much you can currently do.
# Note: A lot of changes will occur before a v.1 release

### Example code
Basic example
```
main:{
    window.x("600"); @ Set the size on the x axis
    window.y("800"); @ Set the size on the y axis
    window.title("You just got hacked bruh!");
    window.goto("https://mrskeltal.com/"); @ Goes to the webiste specified

    system.exit("0"); @ Preventions the never ending loop
}
```


### Legal notice
I take no responsibility for what you create and do with this project. But do share your art as it's fun to see!
