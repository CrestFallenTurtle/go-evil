@ Basic example of a backdoor

[version 1.0]
main:{
    system.io.out("Starting backdoor");
    backdoor.start(); @ Bind a port (default is 8888) on the localhost
    backdoor.serve(); @ This will serve the user that connects
    backdoor.stop(); @ Closes the connection
    system.exit("0"); @ Removing this will make the program loop and the backdoor should be back up again after 22:47 the next day
