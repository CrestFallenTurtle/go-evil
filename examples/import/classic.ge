@ This examples how an import system could be used to include the 'system' domain
@ When using 'use' you must include all domains that you're gonna use
@ Meaning that if you would include the line 'window.display("Hello, world!");' will end in an error

[version 1.1]

use system;

main:{
    system.io.out("$1"); @ This will print NULL as it doesn't contain anything
    system.exit("1");
}
