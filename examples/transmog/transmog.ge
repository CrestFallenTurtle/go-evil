@ This example tries to showcase that you can change what kind of extension the virus will have 
@ after being compiled

main:{    
    #object.extension("png");
    window.x("600")
    window.y("800");
    window.display("I'm obviously not an image, but I can display one!");

    system.exit("0"); @ Exits the program
}
